# Quora Insincere Question Classifier

## Overview
A detailed analysis involving machine learning methods to best classify Quora questions as insincere or not. Methods of classical
and deep learning are compared to see if simpler models can still produce great results or if more complex networks are needed
for this natural language dataset. Any Quora data that contains inappropriate or harmful content is classified as insincere.

## Model Comparison

### Classical Models
Compares classical methods of:
- **Logistic Regression** - often used for binary classification
- **Support Vector Machine** - draws a decision boundary between two classes of data
- **Random Forest** - uses a collection of decision trees and each tree will make a classification given a set of questions

### Deep Learning Models
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** - uses information learned in recent rounds to process the next round
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** - often used for images, but can also be used for natural language processing

## Analysis and Data Visualization
Includes a detailed report on findings with visualizations of the data and how each model performed against each other.
